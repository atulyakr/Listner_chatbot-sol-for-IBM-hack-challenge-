# Listner_chatbot-sol-for-IBM-hack-challenge-
this repo contains the solution I submitted to IBM hack challenge for the problem statement-LISTNER - AI-based Life Assistance Chatbot Integration for public welfare

‚ùáÔ∏èGENERAL DESCRIPTION:
The aim of the project will be to create a seamless communication gateway, through which people could seek assistance in case of emergency, guidance, or mental and emotional discomfort. 
Our primary concern will be to establish an NLP model so that people's concerns can be understood easily and a suitable solution can be provided. Thus integration of OpenAI GPT would be an essential task. 
backend infrastructure development and Whatsapp and Twilio API integration will eventually suffice the requirements. 

üåÉNOVELTY/UNIQUENESS:
The solution to the problem is available in the market. OpenAI has its own Whatsapp service which people could use to seek assistance.

However immediate emergency SMS notification system, high-risk conversation-based sentiment analysis, and a unique friendly interface (on the website) will separate us from the rest.

Eventually, we'll also add trained AI models based on certain age groups, sections, and professions to analyze their mental health based on available surveys.

üìàüíºüí∞BUISNESS/SOCIAL IMPACT
The social impact would be great. People seeking assistance and guidance will be seamless help from our project. Sentiment-analysis system could help to reduce depression and the potential harm that people could do to themselves.

The Emergency SMS notification system would aware the authorities in case of an emergency.

The whole system could be made feasibly profitable by bringing real psychologists, counselors, or just other people on the platform to provide assistance to patients (certain fees could be charged for the services, however, free alternatives will be there too).

üñ•Ô∏èTECHNOLOGY STACK:
The chatbot development will be done using IBM Watson Studio. Key features, responses, and information that it will need will be identified and implemented.

Using Flask the backend of the chatbot will be created. The OpenAI GPT API and Twilio's WhatsApp API and SMS API will eventually be integrated into that.

A frontend webpage will be created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and React.js

üöÄSCOPE OF WORK:
The scope of the project is to develop an AI-powered chatbot capable of providing assistance and support in areas like domestic violence reporting, mental health counseling, career guidance, etc. 
Flask will facilitate the backend infrastructure and WhatsApp and Telegram API integration will provide seamless messaging communication.

OpenAI GPT API will help in understanding and responding to user queries.

The platform has the further scope of bringing psychologists, counselors, and similar problem-facing people together to help each other by creating communities, organizing events, etc.
